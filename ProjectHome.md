The centralized idea-storms (brainstorm) is the DIGG-like system, member can post their idea or any suggestions in any topic of interest. Each post item can give a score +1 or -1 to weight the position, if the item has more score than another it 'll list on top of another items. By the way we can check what the idea is popular or what is the problem want to improve or fix. This project is the part of [Idea Connect!](http://innovative.ideaconnect.co.cc)
